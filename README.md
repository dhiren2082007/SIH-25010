## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3></h3>
<ul><li>Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
- Develop a Smart Crop Advisory System as a mobile app/chatbot platform that delivers personalized and localized crop recommendations. - Integrate soil, weather, and satellite data with AI/ML models for real-time advisories. - Enable pest and disease detection using mobile image uploads. - Provide market intelligence (mandi prices, demand forecasts). - Ensure inclusivity with voice-based advisory in regional languages. - Offline support through SMS/IVR for areas with low connectivity.</li>

## Technical Approach
<h3></h3>
<ul><li>Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware)
echnologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware) - **Technologies:** Python (Flask/Django), Node.js, TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML, PostgreSQL with GIS, React Native/Flutter for mobile app, AWS/Azure cloud, IoT sensors for soil/moisture data. - Data Sources: IMD (weather), ISRO (satellite), Soil Health Cards, eNAM (market prices).
Methodology:

Methodology and process for implementation 1. Data Collection: Soil, weather, satellite, market data aggregation. 2. Model Training: Crop recommendation, pest/disease classification, yield forecasting. 3. App Development: Lightweight, multilingual, with chatbot + voice assistant. 4. Integration: APIs for weather/market data; AI engine for predictions. 5. Testing: Pilot with farmers in 2–3 districts. 6. Scaling: Incorporate farmer feedback and expand across regions.

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3></h3>
<ul><li>Analysis of the feasibility of the idea AND Potential challenges and risks,Strategies for overcoming these challenges
Analysis of the feasibility of the idea Feasibility: High, as similar systems (Kisan Suvidha, eNAM) exist but lack personalization/voice support.
Potential challenges and risks Challenges: Data availability, connectivity issues, farmer adoption.
Strategies for overcoming these challenges Mitigation Strategies: Offline features, partnerships with govt/NGOs, farmer training workshops.</li>
</ul>

## Impact and Benefits
<h3><ul><li>
Potential impact on the target audience and Benefits of the solution (social, economic, environmental, etc.) Social: Empowers farmers with scientific, localized knowledge. - Economic: Increases yield by 15–25%, reduces input costs by 10–20%, improves income. - Environmental: Promotes sustainable practices, reduces chemical overuse.</h3>
